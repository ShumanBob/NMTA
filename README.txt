The website is deployed using deployment.py. 
This will not work unless pyngrok is installed and it has been given the authentication token for a ngrok account.
Note that the chatbot will not work unless the computer that is deploying the website has Ollama installed and our trained model compiled.
More notes about compiling the LLM can be found in the NMTA-1.0 folder.
